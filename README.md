## Introduction

I've decided to create a project with the aim  of just doing some general online teaching.  

The main hallmark idea behind this project is to teach using a mixture of both words/but, also, mainly, through employing pictures(actual image screenshots).

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately, I suffer from ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...; which leads to *low attention span*;    
meaning, my attention will normally wonder off from any project I've just **started**...;    
to go and do something else, instead.  
That means, the vast majority of different projects I create;    
-(and, I seem to be interested in just about *everything and more*...?!)-  
tend to remain being **unfinished**/and, therefore, left undone.   

Bearing in mind that this is meant to be a forevermore *ongoing* project...;  
therefore, only time will tell...if I will keep on regularly **updating** it/or, not...?    
Or, if I will get just totally fed up, altogether...; and, just quite simply decide to *move on*...
