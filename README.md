## Introduction

I've decided to create a project with the aim of just doing some **general** online teaching.  

The main hallmark idea behind this particular project is to *teach*:   

- multiple subjects (and, not just merely 'one')  
- using a mixture of both words/but, also, mainly, through employing pictures(actual image screenshots)

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately, I suffer from ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...which leads to very *low attention span*;    
meaning, my attention will normally wonder off from any project I've just **started**...;    
to go and do something else, instead.  

This means, the vast majority of different projects I ever create...;    
-(and, I seem to be interested in just about *everything and more*...?!)-  
tend to remain being **unfinished**/and, therefore, are left totally open and undone.   

Bearing in mind that this is meant to be a, forevermore, *ongoing* project...;  
therefore, only Time alone will, well and truly, tell...  
if I will keep on regularly *updating* it/or, not...?    

Or, if I will, as usual, just get totally **fed up/bored**, altogether...;   
and, therefore, quite simply, decide to *move on*...

## The current stage: Web site 'sitemap'...  

-(**NOTE**: I'm using Linux Mint Cinnamon OS.)-   

At the moment, I've created the following web site layout:  

>tutorials/  
>...index.html  
>...foreword.html      
>resources/  
>...css/   
>...css01.css    
>os/linux-mint/   
>...index.html  
>os/linux-mint/editorial/  
>...about.html  

-(**NOTE** There are other folders/files which have been included...;     
but, here I'm only listing the parts that are already *up and working*.)-

## Possible future changes...

I'm thinking about where and how to store the site...
  
- Initially, I create a main *tutorials* folder...on my computer Desktop; and, then, use Netlify web service...to go upload everything using 'Manual deployment' mode. ADVANTAGE: Secure/No one else has access to the code(unless I send them the link)/also, at any point in time, I can tear down the site, immediatey, straight away...; by going to Netlify configuration...and, just select option: [delete site]. Alternatively, I can 'hide' the site by chosing to rename it: tutorials -> adadafaga; then, the older 'tutorials' named URL address just wouldn't work anymore.   
- At some point, I intend to upload the entire site into of GitHub; -(because, there is no strictly 'private' data being contained inside that cannot be 'shared' with the general public)-; and, then, use Netlify web service...to *link* to my GitHub online **tutorials** repository; and, so serve the pages u from there...using 'Automatic deployment mode'. ADVANTAGE: whenever the GitHub pages change...; then, the site URL adddress should also reflect those change(s), automatically...; and, without my needing to, continually, go through 'Manual deployment', anymore.  
- Optionally, I might decide to use the Linode site hosting service...; -(for which one has to pay a minumum of $5.00 per month to keep a *shared* server up and running)-; and, serve the pages from there. DISADVANTAGE: One loses $5.00 money every month. Also, Linode, just gives you a non secure web site address: http://nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn; meaning there is no automatic (https://) URL prefix.   

-(**NOTE**: There are a number of other possiblities available, too...; such as, site hosting using cloud services: Azure/Amazon/Google/Vercel/-etc.; as well as, there is using Git inside of VSCode...and, uploading files into GitHub that way, instead.)-
