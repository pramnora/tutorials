## Introduction

I've decided to create a project with the aim of just doing some **general** online teaching.  

The main hallmark idea behind this particular project is to *teach*:   

- multiple subjects (and, not just merely 'one')  
- using a mixture of both words/but, also, mainly, through employing pictures(actual image screenshots)

## Disclaimer

Unfortunately, I suffer from ADD/Attention Deficit Disorder...which leads to very *low attention span*;    
meaning, my attention will normally wonder off from any project I've just **started**...;    
to go and do something else, instead.  

This means, the vast majority of different projects I ever create...;    
-(and, I seem to be interested in just about *everything and more*...?!)-  
tend to remain being **unfinished**/and, therefore, are left totally open and undone.   

Bearing in mind that this is meant to be a, forevermore, *ongoing* project...;  
therefore, only Time alone will, well and truly, tell...  
if I will keep on regularly *updating* it/or, not...?    

Or, if I will, as usual, just get totally **fed up/bored**, altogether...;   
and, therefore, quite simply, decide to *move on*...
